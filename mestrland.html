      <h2>Owned by Benny</h2>
       <p>The Empire of Mestrland (<i>Rike til Mestrland</i>) is a pirate state encompassing a large portion of the northern coasts of the Poisk Sea.<br>Its geography can be easily described as harsh and freezing. In the west lay the Western Wastes, (<i>Vestavfallen</i>) a massive stretch of completely uninhabitable snow wastes.<br>The south and east areas of the country are the only inhabitable areas. Vestal lay by the Vestal Forest, while small fishing villages dot the southern coast.<br>Controlled by a pirate regime, the empire is constantly raiding and pillaging small settlements along the coasts of the sea on which it lies.<br>Currently the Principality of Heltslaette is in a state of vassalization under Mestrland due to previous pillages.</p>
